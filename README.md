# DSP_LAB_CODE
This repository contains all the dsp lab codes that are done in class along with each step explanation. Also the initial codes from assignment 1 are not written, but the 2d graph questions are done. 

Udates:
1)Linear Convolution code is optimized
2)Plotting of logrithmic values are corrected
3)Circular Convolution using DFT and IDFT has been uploaded
